         	<h2>The Corporate Restructuring Report</h2>  
            <p>The Corporate Restructuring Report is a subscription based service that&nbsp;provides detailed investment research on spinoffs and post-bankruptcy&nbsp;situations. There are two types of deliverables with this product: 1) a&nbsp;monthly calendar that highlights the schedule of events and our updated&nbsp;opinions, and 2) detailed reports with price targets and recommendations&nbsp;on all publicly traded spinoffs and post-reorgs in the U.S.</p>

<p>Included in&nbsp;the monthly report are predictions on potential ideas and also a&nbsp;comprehensive list of completed transactions. Additionally, we offer news flashes regularly as new spinoffs and bankruptcies are announced, proving you with up-to-date news in this space.</p>

<h3>For Spin Offs our process works as follows:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Once complete filling is provided we produce a report valuing both&nbsp;pieces.</li>
	<li>After it separates, we continue to follow and issue updates if we&nbsp;see an opportunity where the market has mispriced or misunderstood the&nbsp;spin or parent.</li>
	<li>After the event, we continue to monitor the situation for 2-3 years.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h3>For Post-Bankruptcy:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>We issue an announcement if there is an opportunity (prepackaged, equity not cancelled, etc)</li>
	<li>Once their plan of Reorg is approved and it is going trade&nbsp;publically then we start analyzing the business.</li>
	<li>After it begins to trade we issue a report on that company with a&nbsp;current valuation.</li>
	<li>We continue to monitor the company for 3-4 quarters.</li>
</ul>
